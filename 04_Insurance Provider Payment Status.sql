MedCare Plus insurance shows a high number of pending patient payments with the lowest median billed amounts, while paid and failed payments both have elevated billed values,
indicating inconsistency in collection success. PulseSecure‚Äôs paid and pending claims reflect higher median amounts, suggesting more expensive services but also increased
