# Healthcare Data Analysis with SQL Queries

This project applies SQL analytics to healthcare data encompassing patient appointments, treatments, and billing information. Using advanced SQL techniques including **joins**, **common table expressions (CTEs)**, and **CASE expressions**, the analysis provides actionable insights into hospital operations, patient care, and revenue management.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Hospitals often face challenges tracking patient appointments, treatment outcomes, and billing details in a unified manner. Without integrating these critical data sources, it is difficult to:

- Monitor service delivery effectively
- Identify potential revenue leakage
- Assess operational efficiency comprehensively

---

## ‚ùì Analytical Questions

This analysis focuses on retrieving details of appointments that are either **Completed** or **Scheduled**, combined with their associated treatment types, reasons for visit, and billing information including payment status, payment method, and amount paid.

The query aims to answer the following questions:

- Which treatments are most common for upcoming (Scheduled) versus completed appointments?
- How do payment statuses (Paid, Pending, Cancelled) correlate with appointment completion status?
- Are certain treatment types associated with higher cancellation or non-payment rates?
- Are certain payment methods linked to increased cancellation or non-payment rates?

## Key Features

- Integration of multiple healthcare data sources via SQL joins
- Use of Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for modular and readable queries
- Application of CASE logic to categorize costs and flag patient risk levels
- Detailed insights into revenue streams, payment patterns, and operational performance indicators

This repository includes SQL scripts for healthcare analytics that can be adapted for hospital data systems aiming to enhance patient care tracking and financial oversight.

## Query 1: Appointment + Treatment + Billing + Patient Integration
-- Purpose: Create a comprehensive view of appointment status, reasons for visit, treatment details, billing, and insurance provider.
-- Insight: Supports clinical + financial reporting by combining operational and billing data into one unified dataset.

```sql
SELECT
    a.appointment_id,
    reason_for_visit,
    status AS appointment_status,
    b.amount,
    b.payment_status,
    b.payment_method,
    t.treatment_type,
    t.cost,
    p.insurance_provider,
    CASE 
        WHEN status = 'Completed' THEN 'Done'
        WHEN status = 'Scheduled' THEN 'Upcoming'
        ELSE 'Other'
    END AS status_category
FROM appointments AS a
LEFT JOIN treatments t ON t.appointment_id = a.appointment_id
LEFT JOIN billing b ON b.treatment_id = t.treatment_id
LEFT JOIN patients p ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
WHERE status IN ('Completed', 'Scheduled');
```
